### AffinityDesigner_Icons
Just a quick remake of old AD Icons into BigSur style 


##### Note 
As I don't like the current AD Icon at 1.8.6, as it didn't suit BigSur Style, while also less appealing than previous logo, I changed it. Use it at your risk !

##### Install
1. Right click to your App -> "Get Info"
2. Drag the icon into your dialog app logo
3. ( Optionally ) you may copy this logo into your App/Content/Resources before doing step 1-2.

Have fun !
